# Multiple Knapsack Problem Solver - Part 2

This project continues the exploration of solutions to the Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) by implementing two advanced metaheuristic algorithms: Genetic Algorithm and Bee Swarm Optimization. The project uses Java and JavaFX to create a graphical user interface for visualizing the algorithms and their results.

## Project Structure

* **`src`**: Contains the source code for the algorithms and the JavaFX application.
* **`Projet_meta_part_2`**: Contains the project report.
* **`README.md`**: Project overview and instructions.

## Problem Definition

The Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) is defined as follows:

* Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value.
* Given multiple knapsacks, each with a specific capacity.
* The objective is to maximize the total value of items placed in the knapsacks without exceeding the capacity of any knapsack.

## Example

Suppose we have 4 items and 2 knapsacks:

Knapsack capacities: [10, 7]
Items (weight, value): [(9, 3), (7, 3), (6, 7), (1, 5)]

The optimal solution would be to place:

Item (9, 3) and (1, 5) in the first knapsack.
Item (6, 7) in the second knapsack.

## Prerequisites

* Java 8 or higher
* JavaFX
